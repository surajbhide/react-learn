Sample React project while learning pluralsight's react course.

**What I have learnt**

- React allows you to write front end code just like Angular, Ember do.
- It uses JSX file format to write html markup in java code. Felt wierd at first but getting used to it now.
- Seems quite performant.
- For front end development surely one should be familiar with npm/gulp and its features. Makes dev work so easy.
- Flux seems like a good thing. Reminded me of RabbitMQ a bit. (however all get the payload here and also recipients can wait for others [called stores] to finish processing the data first.
